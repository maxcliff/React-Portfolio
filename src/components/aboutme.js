                        Hello! My name is Max and I am seeking employment within the field of web development. I am 23 years old and I currently live in Vienna, Virginia. In my spare time I enjoy playing soccer, walking my dogs, and working out. I am new to web development, but have quickly grown to like it. Before programming, I was working two jobs, one in customer sales and the other in business development. 
                        I considered them to be "jobs" rather than occupations because they were a way to pass the time and make money. This led me to look into other opportunities that I felt would be worthwhile. Coding was foreign to me and I felt there wasn't a chance that it would be something I'd be capable of doing. After taking some advice 
                        from several friends, I decided to give it a try through online courses. After diving into the basic HTML and CSS, I was hooked. The way the code rendered on the page gave me a feeling of instant joy and I couldn't get enough. This led me to look into programs where I could learn at an accelerated rate to augment my learning. I found the bootcamp at George Washington University and my true 
                        journey through the world of programming began! I have since earned my certificate in full-stack web development and I'm continuing to perfect my craft every day. I've learned from my experience that no matter what Iâ€™m doing, if I don't have a sense of pride in my work, I need to make a change. While it was difficult transitioning from working full time back to learning as a student,
                         I know that my choice was ultimately the best and I have a positive outlook on my future in web development.
